I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computing at the University of Connecticut (UConn), under the supervision of Professor [Dongjin Song](https://songdj.github.io/). 

My primary research goal is **AI for time series analysis**, with particular interests in:

- Time series reasoning system
- Advancing time series forecasting with time series foundation models
- Multi-modal time series analysis
- Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting and understanding
<!-- - Graph-based learning for temporal biomedical and healthcare data -->



If you share similar research interests or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to meaningful discussions and potential research opportunities.

I went to college at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) and received my B.S. in 2019 and M.S. in 2020.
