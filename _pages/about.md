I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at the University of Connecticut (UConn), under the supervision of Professor [Dongjin Song](https://songdj.github.io/).

My primary research goal is to **build reliable and interpretable AI systems**. Currently, I focus on **AI for time series analysis**, with particular interests in:

- Time series reasoning system
- Advancing time series forecasting with time series foundation models
- Multi-modal time series analysis
- Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting and understanding
<!-- - Graph-based learning for temporal biomedical and healthcare data -->

If you share similar research interests or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to meaningful discussions and potential research opportunities.

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and my master's degree from [HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).
